# Astro Kami

An internationalised Astro blog template with editorial typography, light and dark themes, Markdown/MDX, RSS, OG
images, and optional Giscus comments and analytics.

**Live demo:** [GitHub Pages](https://automann.github.io/astro-kami)

## Features

- Astro 7 static output with content collections (posts and pages, both validated by Zod)
- English at the unprefixed root and Simplified Chinese under `/zh/`, with locale-aware navigation, dates, archives,
  tags, Showcase, RSS, sitemap entries, and `hreflang` metadata
- MDX support — embed Astro/JSX components, imports, and JS expressions inside posts
- Light and dark themes that follow the system preference and persist the reader's choice
- Bundled variable Newsreader and Inter fonts, plus Unicode-range
  [Maple Mono CN](https://github.com/subframe7536/maple-font) for code and Chinese glyph coverage
- Language-specific typography tokens so English and Chinese can share layout structure without sharing every
  typesetting decision
- Code blocks via [astro-expressive-code](https://expressive-code.com): themes, copy button, terminal frames, line
  highlighting
- Math via KaTeX (`$inline$` and `$$display$$`)
- Custom containers (`:::note`, `:::tip`, `:::important`, `:::caution`, `:::warning`)
- Paginated post archives (20 posts per page) and per-locale tag indexes
- A localized Showcase with priority-based ordering, three featured projects on the home page, and a complete listing
- Per-post OG images generated at build time (Satori + resvg)
- Per-locale RSS feeds, an internationalized sitemap, robots.txt, and a web manifest
- A Pagefind full-text index generated after each production build
- Optional [Giscus](https://giscus.app) comments with custom matched themes
- Optional GA4 and Goatcounter analytics, both loaded via [Partytown](https://partytown.qwik.dev/) so they run on a
  worker thread
- Optional [webmentions](https://webmention.io), fetched at build and cached locally
- Static HTML with no client-side framework or internationalization runtime

## Configuration

Most site-wide personalisation happens in the following files.

- **`src/site.config.ts`** holds the site title and description, author profile, menu, sorting preference, comments,
  analytics, webmentions, and Expressive Code options. Optional profile links such as `email`, `github`, `twitter`,
  `linkedin`, and `mastodon` are only rendered when configured. Optional employment, education, and avatar fields feed
  the About page and structured data.
- **`src/i18n/config.ts`** defines locales, URL prefixes, locale metadata, and interface strings.
- **`src/data/showcase.ts`** contains localized project descriptions, badges, and priorities. Higher priorities appear
  first; the home page displays the top three entries.

**`astro.config.ts`** is where you set `site` to your final domain (used for canonical URLs, sitemap, RSS, and OG image
URLs). The base path is handled automatically — see [Deploying](#deploying); you normally don't touch it.

Replace or add these assets in `public/`:

- `icon.png` (512×512). Drives the favicon and the auto-generated `apple-touch-icon`, `icon-192`, and `icon-512` PWA
  manifest icons.
- `social-card.png` (1200×630). Fallback OG image, used when a post doesn't have its own. The default is a placeholder
  you can swap.
- `avatar.png` (optional; add it yourself). Referenced from `siteConfig.profile.avatar`, used in the About page's
  structured data and any avatar slot you add. Remove the configured path when no avatar is available.

### Per-post OG images

Every post gets its own 1200×630 OG image generated at build time by [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori). The
markup lives in `src/pages/og-image/[...slug].png.ts`. Tweak it once and every post's card updates on the next build. To
skip the generated image and point a post at your own, set `ogImage: "/path/to/image.png"` in the post's frontmatter.

## Writing posts

Posts live in `src/content/post/` as `.md` or `.mdx` files. The filename becomes the public slug, excluding a locale
directory such as `zh/`.

English is the unprefixed default locale. Put Simplified Chinese posts in `src/content/post/zh/`; they are published
under `/zh/posts/`, while default-locale posts remain under `/posts/`. Locale routing and interface strings live in
`src/i18n/config.ts`.

```yaml
---
title: "Your post title"
publishDate: 2026-01-12
description: "One-sentence summary used in cards, social previews, and meta tags."
tags: [tag-one, tag-two]
# updatedDate: 2026-02-01     # optional, shown as "Updated …"
# draft: true                  # excludes the post from production builds
# coverImage:
#   src: ./_assets/cover.png
#   alt: "Description for screen readers"
---
```

About pages are Markdown documents at `src/content/page/about.md` and `src/content/page/zh/about.md`. Showcase entries
are typed objects in `src/data/showcase.ts`; empty the array and the Showcase tab is hidden automatically.

```

## Theming

Shared colour, surface, font, and layout tokens live in `src/styles/global.css`. Language-specific type values live in
`src/styles/typography/en.css` and `src/styles/typography/zh.css`; both files implement the same token interface. Light
and dark palettes are selected through `[data-theme="light"]` and `[data-theme="dark"]` on `<html>`. A small inline
script applies the saved or system theme before rendering to avoid a flash, and the header control persists changes in
`localStorage`.

Code-block themes are configured separately in `expressiveCodeOptions` in `site.config.ts` (defaults: `min-light` and
`min-dark`).

## Deploying

Output is a static `dist/` directory that deploys anywhere serving files: Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel, GitHub
Pages, S3 + CloudFront. Build command: `pnpm build`. Output directory: `dist`.

### Base path

Defaults to root (`/`) — no config needed for local dev, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, a custom domain, or a
GitHub Pages **user** site. The whole site (links, assets, feeds, OG/canonical, manifest, Markdown links) is base-aware.

For a GitHub Pages **project** site (served from `/repo/`), the bundled `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` detects the
subpath and configures it automatically; the only manual step is **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**. For a
subpath on any other host, build with `BASE_PATH=/sub pnpm build`.

### Asset caching

Astro emits content-hashed CSS, JavaScript, and font filenames that are safe to cache for a long time. GitHub Pages,
however, controls its own response headers and currently serves these assets with a short cache lifetime that the
site cannot override. This is fine for the bundled demo, but production sites prioritising repeat-visit performance
should use a host or CDN that supports a policy such as `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` for
paths ending in `/_astro/*` (including project subpaths such as `/astro-kami/_astro/*`), while keeping HTML on a
shorter lifetime.

## Roadmap

The next development priorities are:

1. **Partial done** — Maple Mono stylesheets are isolated by locale and required weight. Further changes to the
   Chinese splitting strategy are deferred because reducing request count also increases content-dependent glyph
   transfer, making the expected real-world benefit too small and unstable to justify the added complexity.
2. Add a complete Simplified Chinese build-time font for Satori so generated OG images render Chinese titles,
   descriptions, dates, and tags without missing glyphs.
3. Add a first-class `translationKey` to the post schema, enabling article-level language switching and accurate
   `hreflang` relationships between translations.
4. Remove the Pagefind warnings produced by the legacy URL redirect pages while preserving their permanent redirects.
5. Split `BlogPost.astro` into smaller, focused modules as a longer-term maintainability improvement; this should not
   block the current visual-system work.
